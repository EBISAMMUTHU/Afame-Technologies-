# Titanic-Survival-Data-Analysis-Afame-technologies


- **Project objective:** 

    **1.** Create a simple model that predicts the number of survivors in the Titanic accident.

    **2.** The process starts with understanding the given dataset and making a plan on how to create insights into the data.

    **3.** The next stage is cleaning the dataset and removing things we don't need in the prediction model such as Name, Ticket, etc., which are not required for the prediction model.

    **4.** Next stage data modelling In this stage we are converting all our Non-Numeric datatypes into Numeric datatypes.

    **5.** The final stage of this process is the Linear Regression model which is used to predict the Survival of passengers in the Titanic Ship.

- **Purpose of Titanic survival analytics:** To predict the survival chances of all the passengers on the Titanic ship.

- **Importance of this project:** To get a better understanding of how Ml concepts are used in the data analysis field.
